I received my PhD in Economics from University of Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne in 2006.
Before joining Betam as senior researcher in 2016 I worked, respectively, at Galatasaray University
and Sabanci University. I did my postdoc at University of Montreal in 2011. My recent
research is focused on firm dynamics with a particular focus on SME problems and innovation,
productivity, labor market dynamics and short-run GDP growth forecasting. I consulted for the World Bank,
the Turkish Statistical Institute, and some other private sector institutions in the past.

I am an R enthusiast. I give R courses at various levels, from introduction to advanced classes.
