## R tutorials

Here are some  R tutorials that may be useful [ **Under development** ]



Here are some PDF slides I used for R presentations.


- [Introduction to R ](R_slides/R_intro.pdf)
- [Multiple regression with R ](R_slides/R_ols.pdf)
- [Regression with pooled cross sections](R_slides/R_pooled.pdf)
- [Regression with panel data](R_slides/R_panel.pdf)
- [Data reshaping with dplyr/tidyverse](R_slides/R_reshape.pdf)
- [R graphics](R_slides/R_graphs.pdf)

Note: Examples and data used in "Regression with pooled cross sections" and "Regression with panel data" 
	are based on Introductory Economics, 5th ed., by J. Wooldridge
